The optical wireless communications (OWC) workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry working in emerging LiFi, visible light communications (VLC), and underwater optical communications, as well as the traditional wireless infrared communications (IRC).
The workshop strives for researchers and practitioners to present, share and discuss their latest research results in the field of OWC.

Yamazato Laboratory provides technical support for the OWC Workshops held at the Global Communications Conference (Globecom) and the International Conference on Communications (ICC) organized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The OWC Workshops contribute to optical wireless and visible light communication research.

We have hosted the OWC Workshops web page in red.
