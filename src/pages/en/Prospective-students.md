We are always interested in having talented and motivated students on our team. We value students who learn from each other and respect the opinions of lab members and colleagues. In addition, we desire to create an atmosphere that promotes personal growth and success.

Students in our lab tackle a wide range of communication engineering problems using a variety of approaches, including experimentation, modeling, and theoretical analysis. Because much of our research is conducted as a collaborative effort, students should be able to work effectively in a group setting. Students interested in joining Yamazato Laboratory as a research student, graduate student (master, Ph.D.), or postdoctoral fellow should contact Prof. Yamazato directly with a letter of interest in PDF format.

Unfortunately, our lab does not provide financial support for students. Therefore, please obtain scholarships and other necessary funds on your own. Also, Prof. Yamazato will not assist you in obtaining scholarships.
